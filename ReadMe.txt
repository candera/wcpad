TODO: 

* How does gathering more noise data affect finger detection? 
* Do other color spaces give better differentiation of fingers? 
* Would more smoothing help? 
* What about a L2 metric between color data? 
* Track border corners 
* Map bordered region to a new 100x100 image 
* Why is CPU so high? Anything I can do to lower it? 
* Try to repro crash that happened when I left the app running for a long time
* Detect image of hand purely as difference against background

DONE: 
* Fix memory leak
